# Rotations

## Survival

- "*434*" is back as "***444***" meaning we can spam Explosive Shot during Lock and Load!
- We can now chain ES casts without filler or delay, without clipping ticks.
- Be aware that four ES casts in a row can still clip one tick.
- This is not meant to be a buff - it is a fix to a major bug that caused us to deal less damage than intended for the past 6 months.
- The way it's been fixed is convenient and now works similar to how it will in MOP.
- The DPS gain is sub 1% under optimal conditions!
- No special macro is needed - just cast ES.
**NO, THIS IS NOT ABOUT HASTE!...**
