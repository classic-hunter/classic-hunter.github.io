# Firelands

## **Beth'tilac:** üï∑Ô∏è

- There are 2 fluid points you can take in the SV branch that are purely non DPS: <Hunter vs Wild> for extra health // <Entrapment> for extra control // <Survival Tactics> for extra mobility // or you can go glass canon and take <Point of no Escape> for extra blasting.
- You can use Raptor Strike on bloating spiders while soaking their explosion to get the 20% damage reduction (from the glyph).
- Deterrence cancels the damage from the bloated's explosion. It does not cancels the damage from the puddles.
- Master's Call works on the slow if you find yourself hit by a puddle.
- For a better pet control on the soaking phase, just set it on the Cinderweb Drones.

## **Shannox:** üêâ

- If you have to switch for MM, both Chimera Shot and Aimshot will work on Rageface. The ability has a 30sec cooldown, keep track of this timer.
- Deterrence does not cancel the damage from the immolation trap.

## **Ryolith:** üõ°Ô∏è

- The boss has a huge hitbox and no grey zone, be aware of this if you have to dps their legs on downtimes.
- The Liquid Obsidians are affected by your freezing trap. Easy LnL proc for you while keeping them out of reach of Ryolith.
- The Fragments of Ryolith are also affected by your freezing trap.

## **Alysrazor:** üê¶

- Be the one placing Hunter's Mark on the boss to see easily on the minimap where the boss is while flying. A lesser option is to activate your elemental tracking.
- Do not let your pet on Alisrazor during the flying phase, it will not be able to hit the boss most of the time.
- Pick up 1 to 3 feathers after her second and third shedding to be able to cast cobra shots while moving without the need of Aspect of the Fox and benefit from a huge movement speed buff.
- If you fly, your pet will despawn. It will automatically respawn once you touch the ground.
- A moth (Ferocity pet) can be used to help silencing the adds if no pet buffs are needed.
- Alysrazor has a grey zone, allowing you to fully dps it on the tornado phase and group with your raid on the ground phase.
- During P4, the two casters are affected by your freezing traps if you want to fish a LnL proc.

## **Baleroc:** ‚öîÔ∏è

- Deterrence does not cancel the damage from soaking but the 30% damage reduction still applies.

## **Majordomo:** üêà

- With good timming you can easily disengage the leap from his cat form.
- If Majormodo leaps far from you during his cat form, tab to one of his clones during the downtime.
- Deterrence does not cancel the damage of orbs, bombs or jumps, your stacks of **Concentration** will be reset if you are hit by those abilities.

## **Ragnaros:** üë©‚Äçüöí

- Ragnaros has a grey zone, allowing you to freely dps the boss while in melee range.
- Deterrence entirely cancels the damage and the bump from Ragnaros' traps. You can take the traps while deterrence is on cooldown and disengage at the last second to avoid the fatal damage from the fall.
- A wasp (ferocity pet) can bring a 2s stun on elementals during the hammer phase if you want a bit more of control.
- You can Raptor Strike Ragnaros before the seed explosion to get the 20% damage reduction.
- For the seeds, the best rotation  would be: pretrap > pool 100 focus before the seeds > Multishot > Multishot > Cobra Shot Ragnaros > Multishot. If you have the 4pT12, try to fish a proc for a free Multishot beforehand.
- As a firefighter during the last phase, you can securely use Aspect of the Cheetah while extinguishing the fires. You won't take any damage during this phase.
