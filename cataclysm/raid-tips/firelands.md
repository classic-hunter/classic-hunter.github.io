# Firelands Hunter Tips

![Firelands](./firelands.png)

## **Beth'tilac** 🕷️

- There are 2 flexible points that do not impact DPS:
  - **Hunter vs. Wild**: Extra health.
  - **Entrapment**: Extra control.
  - **Survival Tactics**: Extra mobility.
  - **Point of No Escape**: Extra blasting (glass cannon build).
- Use **Raptor Strike** on bloating spiders while soaking their explosion to gain 20% damage reduction (from the glyph).
- **Deterrence** cancels damage from bloated spider explosions but does not work against puddle damage.
- Use **Master's Call** to counter the slow effect from puddles if you are caught.
- For better pet control during the soaking phase, set your pet to attack **Cinderweb Drones**.

## **Shannox** 🐉

- If switching to Marksmanship (MM), both **Chimera Shot** and **Aimed Shot** can break Rageface's stun. Keep track of their 30-second cooldown.
- **Deterrence** does not negate damage from the immolation trap.

## **Ryolith** 🛡️

- Ryolith has a large hitbox with no grey zones—be mindful when DPSing the legs during downtime.
- Use **Freezing Trap** to control **Liquid Obsidians**, which also provides easy **LnL** procs while keeping them out of Ryolith's reach.
- **Fragments of Ryolith** are also affected by your **Freezing Trap**.

## **Alysrazor** 🐦

- Use **Hunter's Mark** on the boss to make it easier to track on the minimap during the flying phase. Alternatively, activate **Elemental Tracking**.
- Avoid letting your pet attack Alysrazor during her flying phase, as it will often miss.
- Pick up 1–3 feathers after her second and third shedding to:
  - Cast **Cobra Shot** while moving without using **Aspect of the Fox**.
  - Gain a significant movement speed boost.
- If you fly, your pet will despawn and respawn automatically once you land.
- A moth (Ferocity pet) can be used to silence adds if no other pet buffs are required.
- Alysrazor has a grey zone, enabling full DPS during the tornado phase and stacking in melee during the ground phase.
- During Phase 4, the two casters are affected by your **Freezing Trap**, which can trigger an **LnL** proc.

## **Baleroc** ⚔️

- **Deterrence** reduces damage taken from soaking by 30% but does not completely cancel it.

## **Majordomo Staghelm** 🐈

- **Disengage** can be timed to avoid damage from his leap during cat form.
- If Majordomo leaps far away, tab to one of his clones during the downtime for continued DPS.
- **Deterrence** does not cancel damage from orbs, bombs, or leaps, and being hit will reset your **Concentration** stacks.

## **Ragnaros** 👩‍🚒

- Ragnaros has a grey zone that allows melee-range DPS.
- **Deterrence** negates both the damage and knockback from Ragnaros' traps. When **Deterrence** is on cooldown, use **Disengage** at the last second to avoid fatal fall damage.
- A wasp (Ferocity pet) can provide a 2-second stun on elementals during the hammer phase for additional control.
- Use **Raptor Strike** before the seed explosion for 20% damage reduction.
- Seed handling rotation:
  1. Pre-trap the seed spawn.
  2. Pool 100 focus before the seeds land.
  3. Use **Multishot** > **Multishot** > **Cobra Shot** on Ragnaros > **Multishot**.
  4. If you have the 4-piece Tier 12 set bonus, try to fish for a proc for a free **Multishot** beforehand.
- During the final phase, as a firefighter:
  - Use **Aspect of the Cheetah** safely while extinguishing fires—you will not take damage during this phase.
